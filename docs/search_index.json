就是典型的示例。\n这些技术使松散耦合的系统具有弹性、可管理性和可观测性。与强大的自动化相结合，它们允许工程师用最少的劳动，进行频繁的和可预测的重大功能更新。\n根据这个定义，我确定了三组信息，我称之为云原生的 3 个

云原生互动全景。\n\n在以下部分中，我们将进一步研究这些概念。不过，首先，我希望您注意，云原生的定义是与任何特定的实现或细节无关的。CNCF 在定义中提到的这些，比如容器和微服务，都只是例子。最常见的误解是，在开始迁移到云时您必须采用微服务架构并构建容器。然而事实并非如此。Fremantle 在 2010 年的文章就是证明。他没有提到这些，因为当时这些技术都不存在。然而，他所描述的应用程序不仅仍然被认为是云原生的，而且还被认为是符合 CNCF 八年后给出的定义的。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

云和云计算模型","keywords":"","body":"1.2 云和云计算模型\n在关注主要角色，即云原生应用程序之前，我想先介描述一下我们这个旅程发生的地点，也是云原生应用程序运行的环境：云。如下图所示，我将在本节中定义云及其主要特性。如图 1.2 所总结的，如果云原生应用程序设计为在云环境中良好运行，您应该要知道那是什么样的环境。\n\n图 1.2 云是一种以不同计算模型为特性的 IT 基础设施，云供应商根据消费者需求的不同控制程度来提供服务。 \n云是一种根据云计算模型，支持向消费者交付计算资源的 IT 基础设施。国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）对云计算的定义如下：\n云计算是一种模型，它支持对网络进行无处不在、方便的按需访问可配置计算资源的共享池（例如，网络、服务器、存储器、应用程序和服务等），可以用最少的管理工作与服务提供者交互。\n就像你从供应商那里获得电力，而不是自己发电一样。通过云您可以获得作为商品的计算资源（例如，服务器、存储和网络）。\n云提供商管理底层云基础设施，因此消费者无需担心机器或网络等物理资源。迁移到云的公司可以通过网络（通常是 Internet）获取计算资源。通常会使用一组 API 形成自助服务，根据需要按需调配和扩展资源。\n弹性是该模型的主要特性之一：计算资源可以根据需求动态调配和发布。\n弹性是指系统能够通过资源调配来适应工作负载变化的程度，以自主方式进行资源调配，以便在每个时间点，使可用资源与当前需求尽可能匹配。\n传统 IT 基础设施无法提供弹性能力。公司必须计算所需的最大计算能力，并建立支持该能力的基础设施，即使大部分情况下只是偶尔需要。随着云计算模型的出现，计算资源受到监控，消费者只为他们实际使用的东西付费。\n对于云基础设施应该在哪里或应该由谁提供，没有严格的要求。云服务有几种部署模型，主要是私有云、公共云和混合云。\n\n私有云。为单个组织使用而配置的云基础架构。可以由组织本身或第三方管理，也可以内部部署或外部托管。对于要处理敏感数据或非常关键系统的组织，私有云通常是云计算的首选选项。这也是一个常见选择，完全控制基础设施以符合特定法律和法规，像《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）或《加州消费者隐私法》（CCPA）。例如，银行和医疗服务提供商很可能建立自己的云基础设施。\n\n公共云。为公共使用而配置的云基础架构。它通常是由某组织所有并提供管理，也就是云服务商，都托管在提供商的场所。公有云服务提供商的例子有 Amazon Web Services（AWS）、Microsoft Azure 和 Google Cloud。\n\n混合云。由两个或多个不同的云基础架构组成，由前面的类型绑定在一起并提供服务，就好像它们是一个单一的环境。\n\n\n云计算模型提供了五种主要的服务模型，具体取决于给消费者提供哪些功能。关于选择哪种服务模型的决策，应该是由消费者对基础设施的需求控制程度，以及他们需要管理的哪种类型的计算资源。图 1.3 显示了领先的云计算服务与传统基础设施的比较模型，并显示了维护每个基础设施级别的人员：消费者或云提供商。\n\n图 1.3 云计算服务模型。它们的不同之处在于它们提供的抽象级别（例如，使用 IaaS，用户管理虚拟机）以及谁负责管理哪些虚拟机级别（例如，对于 CaaS，使用者管理容器，提供者管理底层容器基础设施）。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

总结道，“云原生软件是由您的计算方式，而不是由在什么地方计算来决定的”。换句话说，云表示的是何处，云原生表示是怎么实现。\n前面已经讲述了表示何处的部分：云。现在，让我们继续探索如何进行实现。做为一个快速参考，图 1.4 列出了相关特性和简短说明。\n\n图 1.4 云原生应用程序的主要属性是可伸缩性、松耦合、弹性、可管理性和可观察性。

可扩展性","keywords":"","body":"1.3.1 扩展性\n云原生应用程序是可扩展的，这意味着如果需要，它可以为不断增加的工作负载提供额外的资源。根据这些额外资源的性质，可分为垂直扩展和水平扩展。\n\n垂直扩展。垂直缩放或上下缩放，这意味着给计算节点添加或删除硬件资源，如 CPU 或 内存。这种方法是有限度的，因为不可能无限添加硬件资源。另一方面，应用程序不需要做什么特殊设计就可以缩放。\n\n水平扩展。水平缩放或内外缩放，意味着添加更多计算节点或容器（例如，当使用 Kubernetes 时）到系统中。这种方法与垂直扩展不同，几乎没有限制，但它需要应用程序要特别处理以支持水平扩展。\n\n\n传统系统通常会在工作负载增加的情况下采用垂直扩展。添加 CPU 和内存是应用程序支持更多用户，而无需（重新）设计以实现扩展的常用方法。在特定情况下，这仍然是一个不错的选择，但是云需要其他东西。\n在云中，一切都是动态不断变化的，水平扩展是首选。基于云计算模型提供的抽象级别，可以直接启动应用程序的新实例，而不是增加已经运行的机器的计算能力。因为云是有弹性的，所以可以在短时间内动态地进行缩放。我把弹性作为一个主要特性来讨论：根据需求主动采取行动，调配和释放计算资源。可伸缩性是弹性的先决条件。\n图 1.5 显示了垂直扩展和水平扩展之间的区别。在垂直扩展情况下，我们通过向现有虚拟机添加更多资源来扩展。在水平扩展情况下，我们添加另一个虚拟机，以帮助现有虚拟机处理额外的工作负载。\n\n图1.5 当您需要支持不断增加的工作负载时，垂直扩展模型将添加硬件资源给计算节点，而水平扩展模型将增加更多计算节点。\n

松耦合","keywords":"","body":"1.3.2 松耦合\n松耦合是系统的一个基本特性，即系统各部分之间尽可能少的相互依赖。其目标是可以独立地开发每一个部分，以便于某部分的修改，不影响其他部分。\n几十年来，耦合 及其孪生概念 内聚 在面向对象的软件工程中起着至关重要的作用。将系统分解为模块（模块化），最小化对其他部分依赖（松耦合），并对代码的修改封闭（高内聚），是一种很好的设计实践。。根据架构风格的不同，可以对整体或对独立服务（例如，微服务）进行建模。不管怎样，您都应该瞄准目标，按松散耦合和高内聚性进行模块化。\nParnas 指出了模块化的三个好处：\n\n可管理性。由于每个模块都是松散耦合的，因此团队应该可以减少开发的时间，因为与其他团队进行大量协调和沟通就不需要了。\n产品灵活性。每个模块应独立于其他模块进行演变，形成了一个非常灵活的系统。\n可理解性。不必从整体上研究系统来理解一个特定的模块，而是一次一个模块的研究。\n\n上述好处通常都是与微服务相关的好处。事实上您不需要用微服务来实现它们。在过去几年中，许多组织决定从单体服务迁移到微服务。他们中的一些人因为缺乏适当的模块化经验而失败了。一个单体应用，由紧密耦合的组件组成整体，迁移后会产生一个紧密耦合、无内聚性的微服务系统。有时称为分布式单体。如果您告诉我，这不是一个好名字，因为按定义来说它意味着，这是由紧密耦合的非内聚组件组成的。这不全对。是何种架构都无关紧要：糟糕的设计就是糟糕的设计。事实上，我喜欢 Simon Brown 提出的模块化单体术语，旨在提高人们的认识，就是单体应用也可以优化成松散耦合和高内聚，最终单体和微服务都混在了一起，成为“大泥球”。\n在本书中，我将介绍一些应用程序中实施松耦合的技术。特别是我将采用基于服务的体系结构，重点关注服务构建。服务力求高内聚，与其他服务的依赖要最小，服务之间使用清晰的接口相互通信。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick

韧性\n如果系统即使在出现故障或环境发生变化的情况下也能提供服务，则系统是有韧性的。韧性是“面对故障或挑战性操作，软硬件网络仍能提供和维持一个可接受的服务水平”。\n云原生应用程序在动态环境中运行，其中所有内容都在不断变化，并且故障可能随时会发生。这是无法阻止的。过去，我们习惯于把变化和故障作为异常。但对于高度分布式的系统，如云原生系统，变化不是异常：它们是常态。\n您的目标应该是：无论基础架构或软件中是否出现故障，都要确保您的应用程序可用。\n在讨论韧性时，有必要定义三个基本概念：故障、错误和失效。\n\n故障（Fault）。是软件或基础设施中会产生错误内部状态的缺陷。示例：方法调用返回空值，即使其规范要求返回非 null 值。\n错误（Error）。是指系统的预期行为与实际行为的差异。示例：由于上面的错误，将引发抛出 NullPointerException。\n失效（Failure）。当触发故障并导致错误时，可能会发生失效，导致系统没有响应，无法按照其规范运行。示例：如果未捕获 NullPointerException，则错误会引发失效，系统将对任何请求返回 500 响应。\n\n故障可能会变成错误，这可能会引发失效，因此您应该将应用程序设计为能够 容错（fault tolerant）。韧性的一个重要部分是确保失效不会波及到其他系统组件，而是使它保持隔离。您还需要这个系统能够 自我修复（self-repairing），而云模型实际上可以实现这一点。\n在本书中，我将向您展示一些容错技巧，防止故障传播到系统的其他部分。例如，您将利用 Spring Cloud

1.6 展示了可管理性是如何工作的。\n可管理性的一个方面是部署和更新应用程序，同时保持整个系统是启用的、持续运行的。另一个因素是配置，整本中将深入讨论它。您希望使云原生应用程序可配置，以便在不更改代码和构建新版本的情况下修改其行为。进行配置修改很常见，如修改数据源 URL、服务凭据和证书。比如，根据环境的不同，您可以使用不同的数据源：一个用于开发，一个用于测试，一个用于生产。还可以使用其他类型的配置，用于决定是否应在运行时启用特定功能的标志。\n可管理性不仅关系到变更本身，还关系到您应用这一修改是否轻松、高效。云原生系统非常复杂，因此设计应用程序可以适应功能、环境和安全方面不断变化的需求非常重要。考虑到复杂性，您应该致力于尽可能多地通过自动化进行管理，这让我们进入云原生的三个

自动化\n自动化是云原生的核心原则。其思想是将重复的手动任务自动化，以加快云原生应用程序的交付和部署。可以自动化执行许多不同的任务，从构建应用程序到部署应用程序，从基础架构资源调配到配置管理。自动化最重要的优点是它使流程和任务可重复，整体系统更稳定可靠。手动执行一项任务容易出错，而且成本较高。通过使其自动化，您可以更可靠和更高效地得到结果。\n云计算模型的特点是，提供的计算资源都在自动化的自助服务模式中，并具有弹性地增加或减少计算资源的能力。云基础设施的两大自动化类别：资源调配和配置管理。我们把它们称为: 架构即代码（infrastructure as code） 和 配置即代码（configuration as code）。\nMartin Fowler 将 架构即代码 定义为：“像任何软件系统的代码一样，通过源代码定义计算和网络基础设施的方法”。\n云服务商提供方便的 API 来创建和配置服务器、网络和存储。通过使用 Terraform 之类的工具自动化这些任务，将代码置于源代码控制中，使用与应用程序开发相同的测试和交付实践，您可以获得更多可靠的基础设施，可再生、更高效、风险更低。一个简单的例子：一个自动化的任务可能是创建一个新的虚拟机，它有 8 个 CPU，64GB 内存和 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 操作系统。\n配置计算资源后，您可以管理它们并自动配置它们。套用前面的定义，配置即代码 是像任何软件系统的代码那样，通过代码定义配置资源。\n使用 Ansible 等工具，您可以用声明的方式编写服务器或网络的配置。例如，在上面设置 Ubuntu 服务器之后，您可以自动完成安装 Java 运行时环境（JRE）16.0.1、Python 3.7、在防火墙打开端口 8080 和 8443。这也适用于应用程序的配置。\n通过自动化所有任务，来处理与基础架构资源调配和配置管理相关的工作，您可以避免不稳定、不可靠的 雪花服务器（snowflake server）（每一片雪花都是独一无二的，参考 SnowflakeServer ）。如果手动配置、管理每个服务器，结果将是一个独一无二的 雪花：一个脆弱的、独特的服务器，无法复制，任何更改都有风险。自动化有助于避免这种情况，有利于生成 凤凰服务器（phoenix servers）（凤凰涅槃，浴火重生，参考 PhoenixServer）：在这些服务器上执行的所有任务都是自动化的，每个更改都可以在源服务器中跟踪控制、降低风险，并且每个设置都是可复制的。将这一概念发挥到极致，实现所谓的 不可变服务器（参考 ImmutableServer），CNCF 在其云原生中也提到了这一点，来定义不可变的基础设施。\n初始资源调配和配置后，不可变服务器 不再更改：它们是不变的。如果需要任何更改，则修改其定代码并提交。一个新的服务器最终根据新代码进行设置和配置，而上一个服务器被销毁。\n在下一节中，我将讨论构建和部署应用程序的自动化。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick =

DevOps","keywords":"","body":"1.4.3 DevOps\nDevOps 是另一个流行语，但有时也被误解了。当转向云原生时，这是一个需要掌握的重要概念。\nDevOps 的起源很奇特。如果您有兴趣，我建议您在 YouTube 上看看 Ken Mugrage 的演讲。其中一个令人好奇的方面是，这部电影的创作者决定不提供这个概念的定义。结果是不同的人有不同的理解，我们最终使用 DevOps 表示了很多不同的东西。\n在 DevOps 的所有定义中，我找到了 Ken Mugrage 提出的定义。他强调了 DevOps 的真正含义，其中包含大量信息也很有趣。\n一种文化，在这种文化中，人们不分头衔或背景，共同规划、开发、部署和运维一个系统。\n因此，DevOps 是一种文化，它是关于为了一个共同的目标而共同努力的。开发人员、测试人员、运维人员/运维工程师和其他人员，无论其职称或背景如何，都会参与，一起把想法带到生产中。\n这意味着各自为战的终结，功能团队、QA 团队和运维团队之间不再有隔阂。DevOps 通常被认为是敏捷的自然延续，这也是小团队经常使用的概念，来向客户提供价值。亚马逊首席技术官 Werner Vogels 在 2006 年的一句著名的话，更简洁的描述了 DevOps，那时 DevOps 还未成型：“您建立它，您运行它”。\n在定义了什么是 DevOps 之后，让我们简要介绍一下它不是什么。\n\nDevOps 并不意味着没有运维。一个常见的错误是认为开发人员负责运维，这里运维人员的角色消失了。这是一种合作。一个团队包括这两种角色，有助于提高团队的整体技能，将创意变成产品。\nDevOps 不是一个工具。像 Docker、Ansible、Splunk 和 Prometheus 这样的工具通常是称为 DevOps 工具，但这是错误的。DevOps 是一种文化。您不会因为使用这些工具而成为 DevOps 组织。换句话说，DevOps 不是产品，而是相关促成者的工具。\nDevOps 不是自动化。即使自动化是 DevOps 的重要组成部分，但不是 DevOps 的定义。DevOps 是关于开发者和运维人员从构思到实践的合作，同时可能自动化一些流程，如 持续交付。\nDevOps 不是一个角色。如果我们认为 DevOps 是一种文化，一种观念，很难理解 DevOps 角色。然而，对 DevOps 工程师的要求越来越高。通常，当招聘人员寻找 DevOps 工程师时，他们需要的技能包括熟练使用自动化工具、脚本和 IT 系统。\nDevOps 不是一个团队。没有充分了解上述风险的组织，最终会保持与以前相同的思路。只不过是这样变化：添加一个 DevOps 筒仓（silo, 参考 Analysing the DevOps Silo）替换 Ops 筒仓或什么别的筒仓。\n\n开发人员和运维人员之间的协作，在云原生中至关重要。您可能已经注意到，设计和构建云原生应用程序，需要您始终记住您将在哪里部署这些应用程序：云端。与运维人员合作允许开发人员设计和制造更高质量的产品。它叫 DevOps。但是让我们记住，这个定义不仅仅适用于开发人员和运维人员。相反，它泛指各类人，不分头衔或背景。这意味着合作也在其他角色之间进行，如测试人员和安全专家。他们共同负责整个产品生命周期的工作。有了 DevOps 思维，您可以真正实现 CNCF 定义的云原生应用目标：“允许工程师用最少的劳动，进行频繁的和可预测的重大功能更新”。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

都不需要构建容器，但这些都被归类为云原生。\n在本节中，我将描述一些常见的云原生拓扑。首先，我将介绍容器和编排的概念，后续讨论 Docker 和 Kubernetes 时将进一步探讨这些概念。然后，我将介绍无服务器技术和函数的主题（FaaS）。在本书中，我不重点介绍 FaaS 模型，但我将介绍如何使用 Spring Native 和 Spring Cloud Function 构建无服务器应用程序。\n图 1.9 突出显示了我将在本节中介绍的概念。\n\n图 1.9 主要的云原生计算模型是容器（由编排器管理）和无服务器模型。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

容器","keywords":"","body":"1.6.1 容器\n想象一下，您加入了一个团队，开始开发一个应用程序。您要做的第一件事就是遵循开发指南，将自己的开发环境设置成与同事类似的环境。您开发一个新特性，然后在质量测试（QA）环境中测试它。一旦验证通过，应用程序就可以准备部署，再经过一些额外的测试，就可以上生产。该应用程序是为在特定的环境中运行而构建的，因此必须使所有涉及的环境尽可能相似。您要怎么保证这一点呢？这就是容器的价值所在。\n在使用容器之前，您将依赖虚拟机来保证环境的可复制性、隔离和可配置性。虚拟化通过利用虚拟机监控程序进行硬件抽象，使其能够在同一台物理机上运行多个操作系统，以一种相互隔离的方式。虚拟机监控程序将直接在机器硬件上运行（类型 1 ）或主机操作系统上运行（类型 2 ）。\n另一方面，OS 容器是一个轻量级的可执行包，包含所有需要在内部运行应用程序的内容。容器共享同一内核：无需完全引导操作系统来添加新的隔离上下文。在 Linux 上，这可以利用 Linux 内核提供的功能。包括：\n\n名称空间（namespaces） 用于在进程之间划分资源，以便每个进程（或进程组）只能看到机器上可用资源的子集；\n控制组（cgroups） 用于控制和限制进程（或进程组）的资源使用。\n\n\n仅使用虚拟化时，硬件是共享的，而容器也共享相同的操作系统内核。无论如何，两者都提供了用于隔离运行软件的计算环境，即使隔离的程度是不一样的。\n\n图 1.10 显示了虚拟化和容器技术之间的区别。\n\n图 1.10 虚拟化和容器技术在隔离上下文中共享的内容不同。虚拟机只共享硬件。容器也共享操作系统内核。后者更轻、更便携。 \n为什么容器在云原生应用中如此流行？传统上，您必须在虚拟机上安装并维护 JRE 和中间件，以使应用程序运行起来。而容器可以在几乎任何计算环境中可靠运行，独立于应用程序、其依赖项或中间件。不管是哪种应用程序，用哪种语言编写，或使用哪种库。从外部看，所有容器都有一个相似的形状，就像用于运输的集装箱一样。\n因此，容器实现了灵活性、跨不同环境的可移植性和可重复部署性。由于轻量，对资源的要求较低，它们非常适合在云中运行，因为实例都是一次性的，会经常快速地扩缩。相比之下，构建和销毁虚拟机要昂贵得多，而且费时。\n\n容器！到处都是容器！\n容器（Container） 是一个可以表示不同事物的词，这取决于文本的上下文。有时候模棱两可会产生一些混乱，所以让我们看看它在不同的语境中意味着什么。\n\n操作系统。操作系统容器是一个与系统其余部分隔离的环境，是在系统中运行一个或多个进程的方法。在本书中，我们将重点介绍 Linux 容器，但请注意 Windows 容器也存在。\nDocker。Docker 容器是 Linux 容器的实现，开放容器计划（OCI）已将其标准化。\nSpring。Spring 容器是指应用程序上下文，其中属性和其他应用程序资源被管理和执行。\nServlet。利用 Java Servlet API，Servlet 容器为 web 应用程序提供运行时。如 Tomcat 服务器的 Catalina 组件，就是 Servlet 容器的一个示例。\n\n\n虚拟化和容器并不是相互排斥的。实际上，您可以在云中同时使用它们：在虚拟机组成的基础架构中运行容器。IaaS 模型（基础架构即服务）提供了一个虚拟化层，可以用于引导新的虚拟机。最重要的是，您可以直接运行您的容器。\n在开发或执行一些早期测试时，应用程序通常由在同一台机器上运行的不同容器组成。但您很快就会发现，需要管理的容器太多，实在太复杂了。尤其是当您为扩展性而开始复制容器时，将容器分布到不同的机器上。那时，您就应该开始依赖 CaaS 模型（容器即服务）提供更高级别的抽象了。它提供计算机集群中部署和管理容器的功能。请注意，在此场景中，仍然有一个虚拟化层。\n即使在使用诸如 Heroku 或 Cloud Foundry 之类的 PaaS 平台时，也会涉及容器。您在这些平台上部署应用程序，只需提供 JAR 工件，平台处理 Java 运行时环境、中间件、操作系统和任何需要的依赖项。在幕后，他们用所有这些组件构建了一个容器，并最终运行了您的 JAR。所不同的是，不再由您负责建造一个容器，而是平台本身为您完成了这一任务。一方面，这很方便，开发人员的责任少了。另一方面，您放弃了对运行时和中间件的控制，只能使用供应商固定提供的中间件类型。\n在这本书中，您将学习如何使用 Cloud Native Buildpacks 对 Spring 应用程序进行容器化，您将使用 Docker 在本地环境中运行它们。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

模型）转移到容器集群（CaaS 模型）时，我们还需要更新我们的观念。在 IaaS 中，我们关注单个计算节点，就是个虚拟服务器。在 CaaS 中，底层基础设施是抽象的，我们关注的是节点集群。有了 CaaS 解决方案提供的新视角，部署目标将不再是一台机器，而是一个集群。像 Kubernetes 这样的 CaaS 平台，为云原生环境中我们所关心的这些问题，提供了解决方案：跨集群编排容器。这两种不同的拓扑如图 1.11 所示。\n\n图 1.11 容器的部署目标是一台机器，而对于编排器来说，它是一个集群。 \n容器编排可帮助您自动化许多不同的任务：\n\n管理集群，必要时启动和关闭机器；\n将集群中的容器进行调度并部署，直到满足容器对 CPU 和内存的要求；\n动态扩展容器实例，利用运行状况监测实现高可用性和韧性；\n为容器建立相互通信的网络，定义路由、服务发现和负载平衡；\n向因特网公开服务，建立端口和网络；\n根据特定标准向容器分配资源；\n配置容器中运行的应用程序；\n确保安全并强制执行访问控制策略。\n\n指令编排工具是以声明方式完成的，例如，通过 YAML 文件。按照特定工具定义的格式和语言，您通常描述希望实现的状态：希望在集群中部署 3 个 web 应用程序容器副本、向 Internet 公开其服务。\n容器编排器可以使用 Kubernetes、Docker Swarm 或 Apache Mesos。在这本书中，您将学习如何使用 Kubernetes 为 Spring

Azure Functions 这样的 FaaS 平台就是无服务器模式的例子。在使用这些平台时，您只需要提供业务逻辑函数。平台将设置运行该函数所需的整个基础设施。函数是按使用次数计算成本的。\n如果您正在为事件驱动应用程序使用函数，则它们将仅在发生事件时运行。事件可以是外部的，也可以由另一个函数生成。例如，当有消息添加到队列中时，函数可能被触发，然后执行函数，最后退出执行。当无需处理时，平台会关闭所有相关资源。所以您可以只为实际使用付费。而在其他云拓扑，如 CaaS 或 PaaS，始终有一台服务器在全天候运行。与传统的系统相比，您可以利用动态伸缩性来减少资源数量，只在特定时间提供服务。无服务器模型仅在必要时才提供资源，如果没有要进行处理的，一切都将关闭。\n无服务器模式不仅包括 FaaS，还包括其他技术。例如 Knative 是一种在 Kubernetes 之上构建无服务器平台的工具，可以将应用程序作为容器和函数运行。\n除了成本优化之外，无服务器技术还将一些额外的责任从应用转到平台。这可能是一个优势，因为它允许开发人员集中精力，只需关心业务逻辑。您也要认识到，这种情况下必须处理好供应商锁定的问题。每个 FaaS，以及通常的无服务器平台，都有自己的功能和特性 API。一旦开始为特定平台编写函数，就无法轻松地将其移植另一个平台。使用 FaaS

应用程序，代码分解为表示层、业务层和数据层。\n随着应用程序复杂性的增加和对敏捷性的需求，人们开始探索进一步对代码进行分解的方法。一种新的架构风格进入历史舞台：微服务。近几年来，这种架构风格越来越流行，许多公司决定根据这种新风格重构他们的应用程序。微服务与单体应用程序的异同如图 1.13 所示。\n\n图 1.13 单体式与微服务。单体结构是多层的。微服务是由可以独立部署的不同组件组成。 \n主要区别在于应用程序的分解方式。单体应用程序分为 3 层。相反，基于微服务的应用程序与多个组件关联，每个组件只实现一项功能。还有很多模式被提出，可将单体应用分解为微服务，以处理多个组件而不是一个组件的复杂性。\n\n这本书不是关于微服务的。因此，我不会进行更多详述。如果您是对这个话题感兴趣，Manning 出版社有几本关于微服务的书。比如 Chris Richardson 的 “Microservice Patterns”，还有 John Carnell 和 Illary Huaylupo Sanchez 合著的 “Spring Microservices”。如果您不熟悉微服务，不用担心，阅读本书并不要求您必须掌握这这方面的知识。\n\n在经历了多年成功和失败的迁移之后，在开发人员社区，展开了对这种流行的架构风格的激烈讨论。一些开发者建议切换到 微服务以减少组件的数量，从而降低管理它们的复杂性。其他人则提出了 城堡 （citadel） 架构风格，由一个中心的单体，以及环绕的微服务组成。尽管如此，其他人仍在鼓吹以模块化单体的形式回归单体应用。\n最后，我认为重要的是选择一个能够支撑我们的业务，为客户提供价值的架构。这也我们开发应用程序的初衷。\n每种架构风格都有其用武之地。世上没有银弹或适用一切的解决方案。大多数与微服务相关的负面体验都是由其他问题导致的，例如错误的代码模块化。单体应用与微服务之间不应水火不容。\n在本书中，我有兴趣向您展示如何使用 Spring 构建云原生应用程序，并将其作为 Docker 容器部署到 Kubernetes。云原生应用程序是分布式的，就像微服务一样。您将发现通常讨论的微服务主题，实际上属于分布式系统，例如：路由和服务发现。云原生应用程序是松散耦合的，这是微服务的一个特性。\n即使存在很多类似的地方，理解云原生应用程序与微服务不完全一样，也是至关重要的。您可以使用微服务风格来实现云原生应用。事实上，许多开发人员都是这样做的。但这不是一个硬性要求。在这本书中，我将使用可能称之为 基于服务 的架构。也许这不是一个吸引人的名字，但这对我们来说已经足够了。我们开发服务，它们可以是任意大小，并且它们可以根据不同的原则进行逻辑封装。以后您想要开发什么样的服务都行，只要根据组织和业务需求来设计。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName ===

BigQuery）。\n云原生数据服务是一个迷人的主题，但在本书中，我们将主要讨论应用程序。与数据相关的问题，如集群、复制、一致性或分布式事务不会在书中详述。我很想介绍这些，但它们值得用专门的一本书去介绍。\n交互\n云原生服务相互通信以满足系统的需求。通信方式将影响系统的整体特性。例如：选择 请求/响应 模式（同步 HTTP 调用）而不是基于事件的方法（通过 RabbitMQ 传输的消息）将导致不同级别的恢复能力。在本书中，您将使用各种不同类型的通讯方式，会了解不同通讯方式之间的差异，以及掌握在何时选择何种方式。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

SDKMAN（sdkman.io）这样的工具轻松安装、更新，并在不同的 JDK 之间进行切换。\n\n初始化项目\n在本书中，我们将构建几个云原生应用程序。我建议您为每个应用建立一个 Git 存储库，并在 GitHub 进行存储。在下一章中，我将更多地讨论如何管理代码库的内容。现在，请创建一个 catalog-service 的 Git 存储库。\n然后，您可以使用 Spring Initializr （start.Spring.io）生成项目，并将其存储在刚刚创建的 catalog-service Git 存储库中。Spring Initializr 是一个方便使用的服务，可以从浏览器或通过其 REST API 进行访问，以生成基于 JVM 的工程。它甚至集成进了流行的 IDE 中，如 IntelliJ IDEA、Visual Studio Code 和 Eclipse。初始化 Catalog Service 的参数如图 2.3 所示。\n\n图 2.3 从Spring Initializr 初始化 Catalog Service 项目的参数。 \n在初始化过程中，您可以提供有关要构建的应用程序的一些详细信息，如表 2.1 所示。\n表 2.1 使用 Spring Initializr 生成项目时，可配置的主要参数。\n\n\n\n参数\n描述\nCatalog Service 服务所用值\n\n\n\n\nProject\n您可以使用 Gradle 或 Maven 作为项目的构建工具。这本书中所有的例子都将使用 Gradle。\nGradle\n\n\nLanguage\nSpring 支持三种主要的 JVM 语言：Java、Kotlin、Groovy。本书中的所有示例都将使用 Java。\nJava\n\n\nSpring Boot\n您可以选择要安装的 Spring Boot 版本。本书中的所有示例都将使用 Spring Boot 2.6.0-RC1，但任何 2.6+ 版本都应可以。\nSpring Boot 2.6.0-RC1\n\n\nGroup\n项目的组 ID，在 Maven

Dependencies | 要包含在项目中的依赖项。 | Spring Web |\n新生成项目的结构如图 2.4 所示。在接下来的部分，我带领您一步步操作。\n\n图 2.4 从Spring Initializr 生成的新 Spring Boot 项目的结构。 \n在本书附带的代码存储库中（github.com/ThomasVitale/cloud-native-spring-In-action），对于每一章都可以找到 begin 和 end 文件夹。您都可以从与我相同的设置开始，并检查最终结果。例如，您当前正在阅读第 2 章，因此您将在 Chapter02/02-begin 和 Chapter02/02-end 中找到相关代码。\n\n注意：在本章的 begin 文件夹中，您可以找到在终端窗口中运行的命令，该窗口下载一个 zip 文件，其中包含您需要下载的所有代码。而无需通过 Spring Initializr 手动生成。\nGradle 或 Maven?？\n在本书中，我使用的是 Gradle，但您也可以使用 Maven。在本书附带的代码存储库中，您可以找到一个 Gradle 命令映射表，以便在使用 Maven 时使用（github.com/ThomasVitale/cloudnativespring-in-action）。每个项目有不同的需求，这可能导致您选择某个构建工具。\n我选择使用 Gradle 主要有两个原因。使用 Gradle 构建和测试 Java 项目比使用 Maven 要花费更少的时间，这得益于其增量和并行构建以及缓存。此外，我发现 Gradle 构建语言（Gradle DSL）更具可读性，也比 Maven XML 更具表现力和可维护性。在 Spring 的生态系统中，您既可以找到使用 Gradle 的项目，也可以找到使用 Maven 的项目。它们都有各自的拥挤者。我建议您可以都尝试一下，然后再选择让您的生产率更高的那个。\n\n探索构建配置\n让我们首先打开您刚刚初始化的项目，并查看 Gradle 构建出来的 Catalog Service 应用程序的配置，这是在 build.gradle 文件中定义的。您可以在那里找到您提供给 Spring Initializr 的所有信息。\n清单 2.1 Catalog Service 项目的构建配置（build.gradle）\nplugins {\n  id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.6.0-RC1'  ❶  \n  id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.11.RELEASE'  ❷\n  id 'java'  ❸\n}\n\ngroup = 'com.polarbookshop'  ❹\nversion = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'  ❺\nsourceCompatibility = '17'  ❻\n\nrepositories {  ❼\n  mavenCentral()\n  maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/milestone' }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'  ❽\n  testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'  ❾\n}\n\ntest {\n  useJUnitPlatform()  ❿\n}\n\n❶ 在 Gradle 中提供 Spring Boot 支持，并声明您想要的版本❷ 为 Spring 提供依赖项管理功能。❸ 在 Gradle 中提供 Java 支持，设置任务以编译、构建和测试应用❹ Catalog Service 项目的组 ID。❺ 应用程序的版本。默认情况下为 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT。❻ 用于构建项目的 Java 版本。❼ 工件存储库，指定搜索依赖项的位置。❽ 提供使用 Spring MVC 构建 web 应用程序所需的库，引入 Tomcat 作为默认的嵌入式服务器。❾ 提供多个库和实用程序来测试应用程序，包括 Spring Test、JUnit 和 Mockito。自动包含在每个 Spring Boot 项目中。❿ 支持使用 JUnit5 提供的 JUnit 平台进行测试。  \n项目名称在名为 settings.gradle 的第二个文件中定义。\nrootProject.name = 'catalog-service'\n\nSpring Boot 提供了方便的 starter 依赖项，特定用例所必需的库都捆绑在了一起，此功能显著简化了构建配置。这个项目使用的主要依赖项是 org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web，在 Spring Initializr 中名为 Spring Web。此 starter 用于构建 web 应用程序，包括构建具有 RESTful 服务的功能，并引入 Apache Tomcat 作为默认的嵌入式服务器。\n引导应用程序\n在上一节中，您初始化了 Catalog Service 项目并选择了 JAR 打包选项。任何打包为 JAR 的 Java 应用程序都必须具有 public static void main(String[] args) 方法，以在启动时执行。Spring Boot 也不例外。在 Catalog Service 里，您有了一个 CatalogServiceApplication 类，该类是在初始化时自动生成的：类中定义了 main() 方法，也是 Spring Boot 应用程序的入口点。\n清单 2.2 Catalog Service 的引导类（CatalogServiceApplication.java）\npackage com.polarbookshop.catalogservice;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\n\n@SpringBootApplication  ❶ \npublic class CatalogServiceApplication {\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {  ❷ \n    SpringApplication.run(CatalogServiceApplication.class, args);  ❸ \n  }\n\n}\n\n❶ 定义 Spring 配置类，触发组件扫描和 Spring Boot 自动配置。❷ 用于启动应用程序的方法。❸ 注册要在应用程序引导阶段运行的当前类。  \n@SpringBootApplication 注解是包含三种不同注解的快捷方式：\n\n@Configuration 将该类标记为 bean 定义源。\n@ComponentScan 启动组件扫描，能够在 Spring 上下文中自动查找和注册 bean。\n@EnableAutoConfiguration 启用由 Spring Boot 提供的自动配置功能。\n\nSpring Boot 自动配置会根据多种情况被触发，例如：类路径中是否存在某些类、特定 bean 的存在或某些类的属性值。由于 Catalog Service 项目依赖于 spring-boot-starter-web，所以 Spring Boot 将初始化嵌入式 Tomcat 服务器实例并应用最小配置，在几乎零时间内启动并运行 web 应用程序。\n应用程序的设置就是这样。让我们继续为 Catalog Service 开发 HTTP 端点。\n实现控制器\n到目前为止，我们已经了解了由 Spring Initializr 生成的项目。是时候开发一些应用程序的业务逻辑了。Catalog Service 将公开 HTTP 端点并返回欢迎信息。这可以在 REST 控制器中为其定义一个处理程序。它将是一个 GET 端点，向用户返回一条欢迎消息，欢迎用户访问图书目录。图 2.5 显示了交互流程。\n\n图 2.5 用户和应用程序之间的交互，由 Catalog Service 公开的 HTTP 端点返回欢迎消息。\n在 Catalog Service 项目中，创建一个新的 HomeController 类并实现一个方法，负责处理对根路径（/）的 GET 请求。\n清单 2.3 定义一个 GET 端点以返回欢迎消息（HomeController.java）\npackage com.polarbookshop.catalogservice;\n\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController  ❶ \npublic class HomeController {\n\n  @GetMapping(\"/\")  ❷ \n  public String getGreeting() {\n    return \"Welcome to the book catalog!\";\n  }\n\n}\n\n❶ 定义处理程序的类，标识为 REST 端点。❷ 处理对根路径的 GET 请求。  \n@RestController 注解将类标识为处理传入的 HTTP 请求。使用 @GetMapping 注解，可以将 getGreeting() 方法标记为：到达根路径 （/） GET 请求的处理程序。对该端点的任何 GET 请求都将用这个方法进行处理。在下一章中，我将更详细介绍如何使用 Spring。\n测试应用程序\n从 Spring Initializr 创建 Spring 项目时，包含基本的测试设置。在 build.gradle 文件中，自动添加了测试 Spring 所需的依赖项。此外，还自动生成一个测试类。让我们来看看自动生成的 CatalogServiceApplicationTests 类是什么样的。\n清单 2.4 验证 Spring 上下文的自动生成的测试类（CatalogServiceApplicationTests.class）\npackage com.polarbookshop.catalogservice;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\n\n@SpringBootTest  ❶ \nclass CatalogServiceApplicationTests {\n\n  @Test  ❷ \n  void contextLoads() { ❸ \n  }\n\n}\n\n❶ 提供用于测试 Spring Boot 应用程序的设置。❷ 标识一个测试用例。❸ 用于验证应用程序上下文是否正确加载的空测试。  \n默认测试类由 `@SpringBootTest 注解标识，该注解提供了许多测试 Spring Boot 应用程序的有用功能。在整本书中，我会更多介绍它们。现在，只需知道它加载了一个完整的 Spring 应用程序上下文就可以了。这里只有一个测试用例，而且是空的：它用于验证 Spring 上下文是否已正确加载。\n打开终端窗口，导航到应用程序根文件夹（catalog-service），然后运行 Gradle 任务 test，来执行应用程序测试。\n$ ./gradlew test\n\n任务应该是成功的，测试是绿色的，这意味着 Spring 应用程序可以启动，没有错误。但 HTTP 端点呢？让我们来看一看。\n运行应用程序\n您已经完成了应用程序的创建，因此可以运行它了。有很多不同的方法可以运行应用程序，稍后我将向您展示其中的一些方法。现在，您可以使用 Spring Boot Gradle 插件提供的 bootRun。\n在启动测试的同一终端窗口中，运行以下命令：\n$ ./gradlew bootRun\n\n几秒钟后，应用程序应该启动并开始运行，并准备好接受请求。在图 2.6 中，您可以看到启动阶段的日志。\n\n图 2.6 Catalog Service 应用程序的启动日志。\n图 2.6 中的日志中，您可能注意到启动阶段由两个主要步骤组成：\n\n初始化和运行嵌入式 Tomcat 服务器（默认情况下，侦听端口 8080）；\nSpring 应用程序上下文的初始化和运行。\n\n现在，您可以验证 HTTP 端点是否按预期工作了。打开浏览器窗口，访问 localhost:8080/ 并准备好接收本书的欢迎目录吧。\nWelcome to the book catalog!\n\n极地书店 应用程序的开发部分已经完成：您有了一个 Catalog Service 欢迎用户使用图书目录。记住终止 bootRun 进程可以使用 Ctrl+C 以停止应用程序的执行。\n下一步是将应用程序部署到云中。要使其在任何云基础设施上都可运行，您应该首先将其容器化。下面我们讲 Docker。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"02-Cloud-native-patterns-and-technologies/2.3-Containerizing-applications-with-Docker/Introduction.html":{"url":"02-Cloud-native-patterns-and-technologies/2.3-Containerizing-applications-with-Docker/Introduction.html","title":"2.3 使用 Docker 容器化应用","keywords":"","body":"2.3 使用 Docker 容器化应用\nCatalog Service 应用程序可以运行了。在将其部署到云中之前，您应该对它进行容器化，这是为什么呢？容器提供了与周围环境的隔离，并具有应用程序运行所需的所有依赖项。在我们的例子中，大多数依赖项由 Gradle 管理，并与应用程序打包在一起（JAR 制品）。但 Java 运行时并非如此。将应用程序容器化，意味着它将独立且可跨任何云环境进行移植。如果没有容器，您需要在您想要部署应用程序的计算机上安装 JRE 17（您的应用程序正在使用的版本）。使用容器，您可以用标准方式管理所有应用程序，而不管应用使用的是何种语言和何种框架。\nDocker 是 Linux 容器最常用的实现。在 Docker 网站上（www.docker.com），您可以找到适用您本地环境的 Docker 设置说明，包括 macOS、Linux 或 Windows。对于 macOS 和 Windows，您可以下载 Docker Desktop 应用程序。对于Linux，您可以找到在多个发行版上安装 Docker 的说明。一旦您设置好了 Docker，您就可以继续探索它是如何工作的，以及如何使用它运行容器化的 Spring Boot 应用程序。\n\nmacOS 和 Windows 上的 Docker 是如何工作的？\n在上一章中，您了解到容器共享相同的操作系统内核并依赖于 Linux 特性，如 namespaces 和 cGroup。我们将在 Linux 的 Docker 容器中运行 Spring Boot 应用程序，但 Docker 也能在 macOS 或 Windows 机器上工作吗？\n当您在 Linux 操作系统上安装 Docker 时，您将获得完整的 Linux 主机上的 Docker 引擎软件。相反，如果您安装 Docker Desktop for Mac 或 Docker Desktop for Windows，只有 Docker 客户端安装在 macOS/Windows 主机上。在此场景中，会配置一个轻量级 Linux 虚拟机，Docker 服务器组件安装在该虚拟机上。作为使用者，您将获得几乎与 Linux 机器上相同的体验，也几乎不会注意到差别。但实际上，无论何时使用 Docker CLI 执行操作时，您实际上是在与一台虚拟机上的 Docker 服务器进行交互（即运行 Linux 的虚拟机）。\n您可以通过启动 Docker 并运行 docker version 命令来验证它。如图 2.7 所示，您会注意到 Docker 客户端正在 darwin/amd64 体系结构（在 macOS 上）或 windows/amd64 （在 Windows 上）上运行，而 Docker 服务器在 linux/amd64 上运行。\n\n图 2.7 在 macOS/Windows 上，Docker 客户端组件在您的计算机上运行，而服务器运行在轻量级 Linux 虚拟机上。\n\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick =

Docker 介绍：镜像和容器","keywords":"","body":"2.3.1 Docker 介绍：镜像和容器\n在机器上安装 Docker 软件时，您将获得 Docker 引擎包，其基于 客户机/服务器 体系结构。Docker 服务器（Docker server）包含 Docker 守护进程（Docker daemon），j是负责创建和管理 Docker 对象（如：镜像、卷、网络）的后台进程。Docker 服务器运行的机器称为 Docker 主机（Docker Host），要运行容器服务的计算机都是 Docker 主机，因此它具有正在运行的 Docker 守护进程。容器的可移植性是通过守护进程实现的。后续介绍中，我可能会混用 Docker 服务器和 Docker 守护进程。\nDocker 守护进程公开了一个 REST API，您可以使用它来发送指令。例如：运行容器或创建卷。Docker 客户端通过该 API 与守护进程对话。这个客户端是基于命令行的，可以通过以下两种方式与 Docker 守护进程交互：脚本（例如 Docker Compose）或直接通过 Docker CLI。\n除了作为 Docker 引擎特征的客户机和服务器组件之外，另一个重要的平台元素是镜像中心（container registry），它具有与 Maven 存储库类似的功能。Maven 存储库用于托管和分发 Java 库，而镜像中心对容器镜像执行相同的操作。我们区分公共和私有注册中心。Docker 公司提供一个名为 Docker Hub（Hub.Docker.com）的公共注册中心，这在本地 Docker 安装时是默认配置的，其中为许多常见的应用程序托管镜像，如 Ubuntu、PostgreSQL 和 OpenJDK。\n\n图 2.8 显示了 Docker 客户端、Docker 服务器和镜像注册中心如何交互。\nDocker 守护进程管理不同的对象。在本节中，我将重点介绍镜像和容器。\n容器镜像（或者简单地说，镜像）是一个轻量级的可执行包，包括运行内部应用程序所需的一切。Docker 镜像格式是最常用的镜像格式，后来由开放容器计划（OCI）项目标准化成了 OCI 镜像。通过在 Dockerfile（一个包含生成镜像的所有步骤的，基于文本的文件）中定义指令，可以从头开始创建镜像。通常，镜像是基于另一个镜像的。例如，您可以在 OpenJDK 的基础上构建一个镜像。您可以添加一个 Java 应用程序。创建后，可以将镜像推送到像 DockerHub 这样的镜像中心。一个基本名称和标记用于标识每个镜像，其中标记通常是版本号。例如，版本 20.04 的 Ubuntu 镜像称为 Ubuntu:20.04。冒号用于分隔基本名称和版本。\n容器是镜像的可运行实例。您可以从 Docker CLI 或 Docker Compose 管理容器生命周期：可以启动、停止、更新和删除容器。容器由它们所基于的基本镜像和启动时提供的配置定义（例如，用于自定义容器的环境变量）。默认情况下，容器之间，以及容器和主机之间是隔离的。但可以通过特定端口暴露服务，这通过端口转发（port forwarding）或端口映射（port mapping）来实现。容器可以有任意名称。如果未指定，Docker 服务器将分配一个随机的，像 bazinga_schrodinger。要运行容器，您需要 Docker 或任何其他与 OCI 标准兼容的容器运行时。\n要运行新容器，可以使用 Docker CLI 与 Docker 守护进程进行交互，它检查指定的镜像是否已存在于本地服务器中。若不存在，将在注册中心查找并下载镜像，然后运行。整个工作流程，同样，如图 2.8 所示。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

Pivotal 发起的项目，现在由 CNCF 托管。可以自动将应用程序源代码转换为容器镜像，而不是使用低级别的 Dockerfile。\nPaketo Buildpacks（一种 Cloud Native Buildpacks 的实现）与 Spring Boot 插件完全集成，适用于 Gradle 和 Maven。这意味着您可以容器化您的 Spring Boot 应用程序，而无需下载任何其他工具，无需任何额外的依赖项，也不需要编写 Dockerfile。\n第 6 章将描述 Cloud Native Buildpacks 项目如何工作，以及如何配置它进行容器化 Spring Boot 应用程序。现在，我将给简单您演示下使用方法。\n打开终端窗口，导航到 Catalog Service 项目的根文件夹，然后运行 bootBuildImage Gradle 任务。这就会使用 Cloud Native Buildpacks 将应用程序打包为容器镜像。\n$ ./gradlew bootBuildImage\n\n第一次运行任务时，会需要一段时间来下载 BuildPack 创建容器镜像用到的软件包。第二次，只需要几秒钟。默认情况下，生成的镜像将命名为 catalog service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

试点项目全过程，您还差最后一步：将应用程序部署到云。\n您将使用 Kubernetes，它已成为容器编排的事实标准。我将在后面的章节中详细介绍这个主题，但我想让您先体验一下 Kubernetes 的工作方式，以及如何使用它部署 web 应用程序。\nKubernetes（通常简称为 K8s ）是一个用于自动化部署、扩容和管理容器化应用程序的开源系统（kubernetes.io）。当使用 Docker 中的容器时，您的部署目标是一台机器，在前面的示例中也就是您的电脑。在其他场景中，它可能是一个虚拟机（VM）。无论如何，都是将容器部署到特定机器上。如果您需要多台机器应该怎么办呢？当要在不停机的情况下部署容器、利用云来弹性扩容、跨不同的主机连接它们，您需要的就不仅仅是容器引擎。\n这样，部署目标就从特定计算机转移到计算机集群。Kubernetes 可以为您管理一组计算机。我在上一章介绍拓扑结构时，谈到了这一区别。图 2.10 再次提醒您容器部署拓扑和编排器部署拓扑的不同部署目标。\n\n图 2.10 容器的部署目标是一台机器，而对于编排器来说，它是一个集群。\n有几种方法可以在本地环境中安装 Kubernetes。方法一是建议安装 Kind，这是一个使用 Docker 容器运行本地 Kubernetes 集群的工具。因为您已经在本地机器上安装了 Docker，所以这是一种方便获得本地 Kubernetes 集群的方法。您可以在项目网站 kind.sigs.k8s.io 中找到安装指南。这也是我将在本书中使用的例子，但是如果您喜欢，可以自由选择其他工具。另一个可行的选择是 minikube (minikube.sigs.k8s.io）。\n在继续后面内容之前，请确保 Docker 引擎在您的机器上正确运行，并且安装了管理本地 Kubernetes 集群的工具。如果您使用的是 kind，请打开终端窗口，并使用以下命令创建本地 Kubernetes 集群。\n$ kind create cluster\n\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName

提供服务。Kubernetes 可以在桌面、数据中心、内部部署、云计算甚至物联网设备上运行。\n在容器拓扑中，您只需要一台带有 Docker 守护进程的机器。使用 Kubernetes，您可以切换到编排器拓扑，这意味着您需要集群。Kubernetes 集群（cluster）是一组运行容器化应用程序的工作机器（节点，Node）。每个集群至少有一个工作节点。使用 kind，您可以在本地计算机上轻松创建单节点集群。在生产环境，您将使用由云平台（Azure Kubernetes Service）管理的集群。\nKubernetes 集群由称为 工作节点（worker nodes）的机器组成，您在这些机器上部署应用程序。它们提供诸如 CPU、内存、网络和存储等能力，来支持容器运行，并将容器连接到网络。\n控制面板（control plane）是管理工作节点的容器编排层。它暴露用于定义、部署和管理容器生命周期的 API 和接口。它提供了所有实现编排功能的基本元素，如集群管理、定时和健康监测。\n您可以通过 CLI 客户端 kubectl 与 Kubernetes 交互，该客户端与 控制面板 通讯以在 工作节点 上执行某些操作。客户端不与 工作节点 直接连接。图 2.11 显示了 Kubernetes 组件体系结构。\n\n图 2.11 Kubernetes 的主要组件是 API、控制面板 和 工作节点。\nKubernetes 可以管理许多不同的 对象 (object)，无论是内置的还是自定义的。在本节中，您将使用 Pod、Deployment 和 Service。\n\nPod。最小的可部署单元。它可以包括一个或多个容器。通常是一个 Pod  仅包含一个应用程序，并且可能包含支持主应用程序的其他容器（例如，提供日志记录或要在初始化步骤中运行的管理任务）。Kubernetes 管理 Pod 而不是直接使用容器。\nDeployment。它为 Kubernetes 提供了关于如何创建和更新应用实例的指南。对于每个实例，它都会创建一个 Pod。\nService。一个 Deployment（一组 Pod）可以定义为 Service，以公开给集群中的其他节点或外部使用者。\n\n\n注意：在本书中，我将用大写字母拼写 Kubernetes 资源对象。当相同的词与术语一起使用时，以便将它们区分开来。例如，我在引用应用程序时使用服务，而我用 Service 时，我指的是 Kubernetes 对象。\n译者注：中文没有这个问题。我们把 Kubernetes Service 对象仍然使用 Service 一词，并不直接翻译成 服务。\n\n当您想要运行一个新的应用程序时，您可以定义一个 资源清单 （resource manifest），它描述应用程序所需的状态，例如，应复制 5 次并通过 8080 端口暴露服务。资源清单 通常使用 YAML。然后，使用 kubectl 客户端通过 控制面板 创建 资源清单 描述的相关资源。最后， 控制面板 使用其内部组件处理请求，并最终在 工作节点 中创建资源。 控制面板 依赖容器注册中心获取 资源清单 中定义的镜像。工作流程同样如图 2.11 所示。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&

为 Deployment 中定义的应用程序创建了一个 Pod 资源，您可以按如下方式验证 Pod 对象的创建。\n$ kubectl get pod\nNAME                                READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE\ncatalog-service-7fff49dd77-9cnd7    1/1    Running   0          21s\n\n默认情况下，无法访问在 Kubernetes 中运行的应用程序。让我们来解决这个问题。首先，您可以通过运行以下命令，在集群中公开 Catalog Service 服务资源。\n$ kubectl expose deployment catalog-service --name=catalog-service --port=8080\n\n有关该命令的说明，请参考图 2.13。\n\n图 2.13 使用 Kubernetes 命令将 Deployment 作为 Service 公开。Catalog Service 应用程序将通过端口 8080 向集群网络公开。\nService 对象向集群内的其他组件公开应用程序。您可以使用以下命令核实一下是否已正确创建它。\n$ kubectl get service\nNAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE\ncatalog-service    ClusterIP   10.96.141.159              8080/TCP    7s\n\n然后，您可以将流量从计算机上的本地端口（例如 8000）转发到集群内服务公开的端口（8080）。还记得 Docker 中的端口映射 8080 吗？其工作原理相似。命令的输出将告诉您端口转发是否正确配置。\n$ kubectl port-forward service/catalog-service 8000:8080\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -> 8080\nForwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 8080\n\n有关该命令的说明，请参考图 2.14。\n\n图 2.14 Kubernetes 命令，用于将端口请求从本地主机转发到集群中的 Service 上。Catalog Service 应用程序通过端口 8000 公开给本地主机。\n现在，每当您访问本地主机上的端口 8000 时，请求将被转发到集群内的 Service 中，负责公开 Catalog Service 应用程序。打开浏览器窗口中，导航到 localhost:8000/（确保使用 8000 而不是 8080）并确认您仍然收到与以前相同的问候语。\nWelcome to the book catalog!\n\n非常好！您从打包为 JAR 文件的 Spring Boot 应用程序开始。然后使用 Cloud Native Buildpacks 将其封装并在 Docker 上运行。最后，您用 Kubernetes 将应用程序部署到集群。当然，这是一个本地集群，但它也可以是任何远程云端集群。这个过程的美妙之处在于它独立于环境，以同样的方式工作。您可以使用相同的方法来部署 Catalog Service 到任何云基础架构中的集群中。这不是很棒吗？\n在第 7 章，您将更多的使用 Kubernetes。现在，请使用 Ctrl+C 终止端口转发。使用 kubectl 删除 Service (kubectl delete service catalog-service)，删除 Deployment （kubectl delete deployment catalog-service）。最后，您可以删除集群（kind delete cluster）。如果您想使用 Kubernetes 做一些实验，我在这里给您列举了一些有用的命令（表 2.3）。\n表 2.3 用于管理 Pod、Deployment 和 Service 的 Kubernetes CLI 命令。\n\n\n\nKubernetes CLI 命令\n作用\n\n\n\n\nkubectl get deployment\n显示所有 Deployment\n\n\nkubectl get pod\n显示所有 Pod\n\n\nkubectl get svc\n显示所有 Service\n\n\nkubectl delete

的商业目标。在一个成功的试点项目之后，该组织决定开始一次云原生之旅。\n在本书中，您将构建一个系统的核心部分，该系统在以下方面具有无限的可能性：功能和集成。管理层计划在短时间内交付新功能，缩短上市时间，尽早获得用户反馈。目标是让书店与每个人、每个地方都很紧密相连。因此应用程序应该具有高度的可扩展性。全世界范围的大量用户以及高伸缩性，这样的系统需要高可用性，因此韧性至关重要。\nPolarsophia

工程中用到的技术和模式","keywords":"","body":"2.5.2 工程中用到的技术和模式\n每当我在书中介绍一个新话题时，将向您展示如何将前面讲过的技术或模式应用于 极地书店 项目。在本节中，我概述一下我们将要解决的主要问题，以及我们将使用哪些技术和模式来解决这些问题。\n网络交互\n极地书店 包含多个服务，这些服务必须相互通信才能实现它们的功能。您将构建通过 HTTP 同步交互的 RESTful 服务。无论是以阻塞方式（传统 servlet）还是以非阻塞方式（响应式编程）。而且 SpringMVC 和 Spring WebFlux （在 Project Reactor 基础上）将是您实现这一结果的主要工具。\n在构建云原生应用程序时，应该记住设计松散耦合的应用程序服务，并考虑如何在分布式系统上下文中保持数据一致性。在需要完成一项复杂功能时，会涉及很多的服务，同步通信可能会产生问题。这就是为什么事件驱动编程在云中越来越流行的原因：它让您克服了同步通信的难题。\n我将向您展示如何使用事件和消息，来解耦服务并确保数据一致性。您将使用 Spring Cloud Stream 实现服务之间的数据流，以及\nSpring Cloud Function 将消息处理程序定义为函数。后一种方法可以自然地在部署到支持无服务的平台，如 Azure Function、AWS Lambda、Knative 等。\n数据\n数据是软件系统的重要组成部分。在 极地书店 系统中，您将使用关系型数据库 PostgreSQL 存储应用程序数据。我会演示如何使用 Spring Data JDBC （被动式）和 Spring Data R2DBC（响应式）将应用程序与数据源集成。然后，您将看到如何进一步优化数据源并使用 Flyway 管理迁移脚本。\n云原生应用程序应该是无状态的，但状态需要存储在某个地方。在 极地书店 中，您将使用 Redis 将会话信息进行外部存储，保留应用程序无状态且可扩展。Spring Session 使实现集群用户传话变得容易。特别是，我将向您展示如何使用 Spring Session Data Redis 集成 web 会话管理。\n除了持久化数据和会话之外，您还将实现事件驱动编程模式。Spring AMQP 和 RabbitMQ 将是要使用的技术。\n在本地，您将在 Docker 容器中运行这些数据服务。在生产中，使用 Azure Kubernetes Service（AKS），您将依赖云服务商提供的托管服务，它解决了高可用性、集群、存储和数据复制等关键问题。\n配置\n在本书中，我将向您展示如何在不同的环境中配置 极地书店 中的服务。首先，我将探讨 Spring Boot 提供的 properties 和 profile，以及何时使用它们。然后，您将学习将 Spring 应用程序作为 JAR 在容器里运行时，如何使用环境变量作为外部配置。最后，我来教您如何在 Kubernetes 中使用 ConfigMaps 和 Secrets。您还将看到如何通过 Spring Cloud Config 进行集中配置管理，以及在运行时使用 Spring Cloud Bus 更新配置。\n路由\n极地书店 是一个分布式系统，需要一些路由配置。Kubernetes 具有内置的服务发现功能，可帮助您将服务与物理地址和主机名分离。云原生应用程序是可伸缩的，因此服务之间的交互应该考虑到：要调用哪个实例呢？再一次，Kubernetes 为您提供了负载均衡功能，因此您无需在应用程序中再进行处理了。\n我将指导您使用 Spring Cloud Gateway 实现一个服务，该服务将充当 API 网关，用于把任何内部 API 变化与外部隔离。它还将是一种边缘服务，将一次性解决跨领域的问题，如安全性和韧性。这样的服务将是 极地书店 的入口，必须高可用、性能良好，并且具有容错能力。\n可观测性\n极地书店 系统中的服务必须是可观测的，这才是云原生服务。我将向您展示如何使用 Spring Boot Actuator 设置健康和信息端点，并公开相关度量给 Prometheus 进行提取并处理。然后您将使用 Grafana 可视化最关键的指标，并显示在仪表板中。\n请求可以由多个服务处理，因此需要分布式链路跟踪，跟踪从一个服务到另一个服务的请求流。您会和我一起设置 Spring Cloud Sleuth。然后，Grafana Tempo 将提取、处理并可视化整个链路，让您可以完整地了解系统是如何完成其功能的。\n最后，我们需要一个适当的日志策略。我们应该将日志作为事件流处理，因此让您的 Spring 应用程序将日志事件流化为标准输出，而不考虑它们是如何处理或存储的。Fluent Bit 将负责从所有服务收集日志，Grafana Loki 将存储和处理它们，Grafana 将允许您查询日志。\n韧性\n云原生应用程序应该具有韧性。对于 极地书店 项目，我将向您展示使用 Project Reactor、Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker 以及 Resilience4J 等使应用程序具有韧性的各种技术，用于实施断路器、重试、超时和其他模式。\n安全\n安全是一个广泛的主题，我在本书中无法深入讨论。不过，我还是会简单讨论这个主题，因为它是当今最关键的软件关注点之一。这是一个从项目一开始就应持续关注并解决的普遍问题，并且不能掉以轻心。\n对于 极地书店，我将向您展示如何将身份验证和授权功能添加到云原生应用程序中。您将看到如何保护服务之间，以及用户和应用程序间的通信。您将依靠 OAuth 2.0 和 OpenID Connect 来实现这些功能。Spring Security 支持这些标准，可以无缝集成以提供身份验证和授权。您将使用 Keycloak 进行身份和访问控制管理。\n此外，我还将介绍密钥管理和加密的概念。当然也不能非常深入讨论这些主题。但我将向您展示如何管理机密来配置 Spring 服务（直接使用配置服务器和 Kubernetes 时）。\n测试\n自动化测试对于云原生应用程序的成功至关重要。自动化测试将在几个级别覆盖 极地书店 应用程序。我将向您展示如何使用 JUnit5 \n编写单元测试。Spring Boot 添加了许多方便的实用程序来改进集成测试，您将使用它们来确保您的服务质量。您将为各种 极地书店 功能编写测试类，包括 REST 端点、消息流和数据集成和安全性。\n保持跨环境的对等性，对于确保应用程序的质量至关重要。尤其是在支持服务方面。在生产中，您将使用的服务是 PostgreSQL 和 Redis。在测试期间，您应该使用类似的服务，而不是模拟或者特定于测试的工具，如内存中的 H2 数据库。Testcontainers 框架将帮助您使用真实服务进行自动化测试。\n构建和部署\n极地书店 的主要服务是使用 Spring。您将看到如何打包 Spring 应用程序，将其作为 JAR 文件运行，使用 Cloud Native Buildpacks 对其进行容器化，使用 Docker 运行，最后，您将使用 Kubernetes 部署容器。您还将看到如何使用 Spring Native 和 GraalVM 将 Spring 应用程序编译为本机镜像，并在无服务器架构中使用它们。利用无服务器的即时启动、即时峰值性能、减少内存消耗、减少图像大小。然后，您将在托管服务器上部署它们，基于 Knative（Google Cloud Run）的无服务器平台。\n我将向您展示如何通过 GitHub Actions 设置部署流水线（CI/CD）来自动化构建。流水线将在每次提交时构建应用程序，运行测试，然后打包以备部署。这种自动化将是向客户持续交付文化的一部分，快速可靠地为客户带来价值。最后，您还将使用 GitOps 在 Azure Kubernetes 服务（AKS）上自动部署 极地书店 到 Kubernetes 群集。\nUI\n这本书的重点是后端技术，所以我不会教您任何前端内容。当然，您的应用程序需要一个前端，以便用户与之交互。 极地书店 将依赖使用 Angular 框架的客户端应用程序。我不会在本书中展示 UI 应用程序代码，因为它超出了本书的范围，但我会将相关代码放在本书附带的代码存储库中。\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick

4 章 配置管理外部化","keywords":"","body":"第 4 章 配置管理外部化\n本章内容：\n\n使用 properties 和 profiles 配置 Spring\n使用 Spring Boot 应用外部配置\n使用 Spring Cloud Config Server 实现配置服务器\n使用 Spring Cloud Config Client 配置应用程序\n\n在上一章中，您构建了一个用于管理图书目录的 RESTful 应用程序。作为实现的一部分，您定义了一些数据来配置应用程序的某些方面（在文件中）。例如，Tomcat 线程池或连接超时时间。下一步可能是将应用程序部署到不同的环境：首先是测试环境，然后是预发环境，最后是生产。如果您需要每个环境的都有不同的 Tomcat 配置，如何做到这一点呢？\n传统的应用程序通常打包为一个应用包，包括源代码和一系列配置文件。包含不同环境的配置数据，并在运行时标记。这意味着您需要更新特定环境的配置数据时，都必须构建一个新的应用程序包。这一过程的一个改进是为每个环境创建不同的构建，但这意味着您无法保证在预发环境中运行的内容，在生产环境中也会以同样的方式运行，因为它们是不同的打包制品。\n配置（Configuration）定义为在部署之间可能发生更改的一切（根据 十五要素 方法论），如凭据、资源处理程序和支持服务的 URL。根据部署位置的不同，同一应用程序将有不同的需求，并且很可能需要不同的配置。云原生应用程序的一个关键特性是，应用程序制品将在整个环境中保持不变。无论将其部署到哪个环境，都不会更改应用程序制品。\n您部署的每个版本都是构建和配置的组合。可以使用相同的构建部署到具有不同配置数据的不同环境，如图 4.1 所示。\n\n图 4.1 您部署的每个版本都是构建和配置的组合，每个环境都不同。\n可能需要跨部署进行更改的任何内容，都应该是可配置的。例如您可能希望更改凭据以访问支持服务、功能标志和数据库资源或外部 API 的 URL，所有这些都取决于您正在部署应用程序的环境。云原生应用程序支持配置外部化，因此您可以替换它，而无需重新生成代码。关于凭据，它甚至更重要，关键是不要将它们与应用程序代码一起存储。无数的数据泄露，都因为向公开的存储库提交了凭据信息。确保您不会是他们中的一员。\n在 Spring 中，配置数据被抽象为 properties，以不同的方式定义键/值对，例如属性文件、JVM 系统属性和系统环境变量。本章介绍在云原生上下文中配置 Spring 应用程序的各个方面。我将介绍有关 Spring 如何处理配置的主要概念，包括 properties 和 profiles，以及如何使用 Spring Boot 应用外部化配置。然后，我将演示如何通过 Git 使用 Spring Cloud Config Server 设置配置服务存储库，作为存储配置数据的后端。最后，您将学习如何通过 Spring Cloud Config Client 访问 Config Server 来配置 Spring Boot 应用程序。\n到本章结束时，您将能够根据您的需要和配置数据的类型，使用不同的方法来配置您的云原生 Spring 应用程序。表 4.1 总结了本章介绍的三种主要策略，以定义云原生应用程序的配置数据。第 13 章将进一步扩展本文涵盖的主题，包括机密管理以及如何在 Kubernetes 中使用 ConfigMaps 和 Secrets。\n\n注意：本章示例的源代码可在 /Chapter04/04-begin 和 /Chapter04/04-end 文件中找到，包含最初和本章结束后的工程状态。（github.com/ThomasVitale/cloud-native-spring-in-action）\n\n表 4.1 可以根据不同的策略配置云原生应用程序。根据配置数据类型和应用程序的要求，您可能会全部使用到它们。\n\n\n\n配置策略\n特征\n\n\n\n\n随应用程序打包的属性文件\n· 可以作为应用程序支持的配置数据的规范。 · 用于定义合理的默认值，主要面向开发环境。\n\n\n环境变量\n· 任何操作系统都支持环境变量，因此非常方便。 · 大多数编程语言允许您访问环境变量。在 Java 中，可以使用 System.getenv() 方法来实现这一点。在 Spring 里依赖于 Environment 抽象类。 · 用于定义配置数据，具体取决于部署应用程序的基础架构/平台，例如活动配置文件、主机名、服务名和端口号。\n\n\n配置服务\n· 提供配置数据持久化、审核和计量。 · 允许使用加密或专用密钥管理机密库。 · 用于定义特定于应用程序的配置数据，例如连接池、凭据、功能标志、线程池和指向第三方服务的 URL。\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" &&
